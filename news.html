<p align="center"><font size="+1.5"><strong>MANILA</strong> â€” The country's <i>police chief</i> vowed Wednesday to ramp up the security measures in Camp Crame<br>
    and said there would be system changes following the <b>hostage-taking</b> of former Senator Leila De Lima<br>
    over the weekend.<br><br>
    
    
    Police Chief Gen. Rodolfo Azurin said the investigation on De Lima's hostage-takingis still ongoing<br>
    and they are looking into whether or not some police personnel were lax in implementing security<br>
    in their headquarters.<br><br>
    
    
    "Definitely, iniisa-isa namin, pinag-aaralan ano ba ang mga kailangan i-correct natin para maiwasan<br>
     na ang mga pangyayaring ganoon," said Azurin during a Palace press briefing.<br>
    (We are studying what could be corrected.)<br><br>
    
    
    "We really need to implement strictly yung mga pumapasok, dumadalaw sa mga nakakulong doon<br>
     na hindi sila makakadala o makakapagpasok ng anything na would hurt anybody inside our jail<br>
    facility," he added.<br><br>
    
    (We really need to implement strictly the checking of those visiting our facilities and make sure they<br>
    would not be able to bring any object that would hurt anyone inside our jail facility.)<br><br><br>
    Among the things they also intent to change are the food distribution process, wherein more than<br>
    one food server tasked and a "buddy system" will be implemented.<br><br>
    
    "Mase-separate na rin siguro ang distribution ng pagkain at sunny time nila. During that time,<br>
     nagkasabay," the police chief said.<br><br>
    
    "We would continue na medyo malayo ang facility ng mga lalaki at babae na nakakulong," he added.<br><br>
    
    
    (We may separate the schedule for food distribution and their outdoor time, because when the<br>
    incident happened, it was the same for both. We would also continue to separate women and men<br>
    detainees.)<br><br>
    
    
    When asked about utensils being used as a potential weapon or a security threat, Azurin said, "any<br>
    object that would be used to hurt anybody in the facility will no longer be allowed inside the jails,<br>
    especially yung mga magagamit ng ating mga preso (especially those that could be used by detainees)."<br><br>
    
    
    He did not clarify though if these would be replaced by plastic utensils and how the ban would take effect. <br><br>
    
    De Lima, 63, was held hostage in the PNP Custodial Center Sunday morning after three suspected<br>
    members of the Abu Sayyaf Group attempted to escape from the facility.<br><br>
    
    
    In her statement, the former lawmaker said she felt a sharp object, which seemed to be a<br>
    screwdriver or ice pick, pressed onto her chest during the short hostage-taking.<br>
    The three suspects were eventually neutralized by responding policemen. <br><br>
    
    
    Press Undersecretary Cheloy Garafil said it is up to the courts to decide on De Lima's possible bid<br>
    for home furlough.<br><br>
    
    An outspoken critic of former president Rodrigo Duterte and his deadly drug war, De Lima has been
    detained at Camp Crame since 2017 on drug trafficking charges.<br><br>
    
    She denies the allegations and has consistently said she is a victim of political persecution.<br><br></p>
